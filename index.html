<p>I’ve taken a screenshot of my folder in the temporary workspace area and placed it in a pictures folder.</p>
<img src="Pictures/1.png">
<p>Then I used the git init command to create a local repo.</p>
 <img src="Pictures/2.png">
<p>This is my new GitHub repo that I created using the GUI on the GitHub website.</p>
 <img src="Pictures/3.png">
<p>I then linked my local repo to the online repo using git remote add origin, and then pulled the GitHub generated information which was just the Readme file.</p>
 <img src="Pictures/4.png">
<p>I copied the code into Visual Studio Code, saved it into my assignment folder and ran it to check it worked.</p>
 <img src="Pictures/5.png">
<p>I used git status to show which files haven’t been tracked, then added them with git add . which adds all files. Next I checked the status again to confirm all files were ready and committed them with an appropriate log message.</p> 
<img src="Pictures/6.png">
<img src="Pictures/7.png">
<p>I pushed the files to the online repo and checked that it reflected my local file structure.</p>
  <img src="Pictures/8.png">
  <img src="Pictures/9.png">
<p>The first of two required changed I made was adding an example username and password form.</p>
  <img src="Pictures/10.png">
  <img src="Pictures/11.png">
<p>Finally I added an example link that takes the user to the hull uni canvas page.</p>
<img src="Pictures/12.png">
 <p>I then added the file and committed it with a brief description saying I added my own changes to the website then I pushed it to the online repo.</p>
 <img src="Pictures/13.png">
 <img src="Pictures/14.png">
<p>I then used the pages feature on GitHub to deploy my site.</p>

<h1>Reflection</h1>
<p>In this lab I used git from the command line to upload and push my website and files I created to my online GitHub repo. From there I used github pages to make an online website and annotated the page with descriptions of what i've done from my word doc.</p>
